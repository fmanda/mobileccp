ViewModel lifecylce depends on owner passed => ViewModelProvider(owner)
so when we set owner as fragment, we need aditional factory for other parameter such as application

move long running task on singleton worker, or sharedviewmodel with owner set to MainActivity

singleton => object or class with companion object

kotlin lambda coroutines : .observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { data -> { .. logic ...} }

Dispatcher.IO optimized for IO operation (db, network)
